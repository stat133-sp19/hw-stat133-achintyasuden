Workout 01: GSW Shot Charts

The purpose of this assignment is threefold:

1) From the logistical point of view, this
assignment will give me the opportunity to start working with a more complex file structure,
and uploading files to GitHub. 

2) From the analytics point of view, this HW involves
visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, I will be producing so-called “shot
charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries
and visualizations.

3) From the report/communication standpoint, I will produce
a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.
