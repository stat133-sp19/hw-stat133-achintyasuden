## Binomial Package
**To install, use _devtools::install_github('stat133-sp19/hw-stat133-achintyasuden/binomial/binomial')_**

## Purpose
*The package `"binomial"` describes perhaps the most famous probability distribution among discrete random variables. This is the theoretical probability model that we use when calculating probabilities about the number of successes in a fixed number of random trials performed under identical conditions (assuming a constant probability of success on each trial).  
This assignment hopes to use the functionality of the binomial distribution in order to build a working R package based on it.*
