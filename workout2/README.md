## Purpose:

The purpose of this assignment is to create a shiny app that allows someone to visualize—in an
interactive way—some of the saving/investing scenarios considered in warmup 6. 

The investing scenarios in this app will consider fixed investments, high yield investments, and growing investments with varying growth and rates of return.

All of these functionalities will be available in the form of a Shiny App.
