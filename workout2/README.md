# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to create a shiny app that allows you to visualize—in an
interactive way—some of the saving/investing scenarios considered previously.

The types of savings scenarios considered include a fixed investment, a high yield investment and a growing investment.

The results of these scenarios can be seen through the Shiny App link provided.
