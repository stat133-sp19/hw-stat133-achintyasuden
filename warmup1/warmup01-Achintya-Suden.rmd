## Recipe

* Angel Hair Pasta With Raw Tomato Sauce
    + 3 Pounds Tomatoes
    + 1 Small Garlic Clove
    + 2 Tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice
    + 1 Teaspoon Coarse Salt
    + 1 Teaspoon Sugar
    + 1/2 Teaspoon Freshly Ground Black Pepper
    + 1 Poud Dried Capellini 
    + 1/2 Cup Chopped Fresh Basil
    + Grated Ricotta Salata  

* Special Tools Needed
    + Box Grater
    + Bowl
    + Pasta Drainer

Recipe Steps: Halve the first pound of tomatoes crosswise, then rub the cut sides against the large holes of a box grater set in a large bowl, discarding the skin. Core (see note up top) and chop the last two pounds of tomatoes and add to the grated tomato bowl. Add garlic, lemon juice or vinegar, salt, sugar (if using) and pepper and let marinate at room temperature until ready to use, at least 10 minutes but also up to 2 hours if you're planning ahead. After it has steeped for a while, taste and adjust seasonings as needed.  

Cook pasta in salted boiling water as package time recommends. Drain then toss with fresh sauce and basil. Serve lukewarm (as it is now) or at room temperature with a drizzle of olive oil and freshly grated cheese on top.

The special season for this meal is **fall**.  

* Variations/Other Ingredients
    + Less Garlic
    + Marinate sauce for 10 minutes instead of hour
    + Use less tomato seeds for less bitterness  
    

## Euclidean Distance

###Definition  
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $\overline{pq}$

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = *(p~1~, p~2~,..., p~n~)* and **q** = *(q~1~, q~2~,..., q~n~)* are two points in Euclidean *n-*space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:  

*d*(**p**,**q**) = *d*(**q**,**p**) = $\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2 + (q_2-p_2)^2 + ... (q_n - p_n)^2}$  

= $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^\infty}(q_i - p_i)^2$  

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** an **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measurese the length of the vector:    

$\|\textbf{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+...+p_n^2} = \sqrt{p\bullet p}$  

where the last expression involves the dot product.
